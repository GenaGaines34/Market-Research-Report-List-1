<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS Sensor</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS image sensor market is primarily divided into Front-Illuminated (FI) and Backside-Illuminated (BSI) types. FI CMOS sensors have structures that capture light from the front, optimizing for low-cost production but may experience sensitivity limitations in low-light conditions. BSI CMOS sensors, on the other hand, allow light to hit the photodiode from the back, enhancing light collection efficiency and performance in dim environments. This distinction influences applications across smartphones, cameras, and various imaging technologies.</p></p>
