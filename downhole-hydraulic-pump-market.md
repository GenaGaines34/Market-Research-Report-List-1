<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Downhole Hydraulic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reciprocating pumps (sucker-rod installation)</li><li>Jet pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The downhole hydraulic pump market is primarily segmented into two types: reciprocating pumps and jet pumps. Reciprocating pumps, commonly known as sucker-rod installations, utilize a mechanical rod to transport fluid, making them highly efficient for extracting oil and gas from deep wells. In contrast, jet pumps rely on the principle of fluid dynamics, using a high-velocity jet of fluid to create a vacuum and lift the produced fluids. Both types serve distinct applications in enhancing well productivity and efficiency in hydrocarbon extraction.</p></p>
