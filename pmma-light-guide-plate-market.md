<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PMMA Light Guide Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incident Light from both Sides</li><li>Incident Light from One Side</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PMMA Light Guide Plate (LGP) market can be categorized into two types based on light incidence: incident light from both sides and incident light from one side. In the former, light enters the LGP from both sides, enhancing brightness and uniformity, making it ideal for applications requiring even illumination, such as monitors and backlit displays. Conversely, in the one-side incident light configuration, light input from a single side directs illumination more efficiently, often used in compact devices where space is limited.</p></p>
