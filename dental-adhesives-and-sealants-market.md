<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching Adhesive</li><li>Selective-etching Adhesive</li><li>Total-etching Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental adhesives and sealants are critical in modern dentistry for bonding restorative materials to tooth structures. Self-etching adhesives simplify the process by simultaneously etching and priming the tooth surface, reducing steps and potential sensitivity. Selective-etching adhesives involve etching only the enamel, preserving dentin integrity, which enhances bonding strength. Total-etching adhesives require separate etching of both enamel and dentin, offering strong adhesion but demanding precise application. Each type caters to different clinical scenarios, optimizing bond strength and procedural efficiency.</p></p>
