<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Private LTE Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FDD</li><li>TDD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Private LTE market is primarily categorized into two types: Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD). FDD uses separate frequency bands for uplink and downlink communications, ensuring continuous data flow and low latency, making it ideal for applications requiring consistent performance. In contrast, TDD utilizes the same frequency for both uplink and downlink, allocating time slots for each, which is more flexible and cost-efficient, particularly in environments with varying data traffic demands.</p></p>
