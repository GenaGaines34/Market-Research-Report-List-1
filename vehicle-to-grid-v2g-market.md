<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional V2G</li><li>Bidirectional V2G</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) technology enables electric vehicles (EVs) to interact with the power grid. In a unidirectional V2G market, energy flows only from the grid to the vehicle, allowing charging during off-peak hours to help balance energy demand. In contrast, a bidirectional V2G market permits energy to flow both ways, with EVs supplying stored energy back to the grid during peak demand, effectively supporting grid stability and creating additional revenue opportunities for EV owners.</p></p>
