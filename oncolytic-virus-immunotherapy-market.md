<p><h1>Oncolytic Virus Immunotherapy Market: A Comprehensive Report of its Market Share & Growth Trends 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Oncolytic Virus Immunotherapy Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Oncolytic virus immunotherapy is an innovative cancer treatment approach that leverages genetically modified viruses to selectively infect and kill cancer cells while stimulating the host immune response against tumors. This therapy harnesses the natural ability of viruses to replicate within cancer cells, leading to tumor lysis and subsequent release of tumor-associated antigens, which heightens the immune system’s ability to recognize and attack remaining cancer cells.</p><p>The Oncolytic Virus Immunotherapy Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13% during the forecast period. This market expansion is driven by technological advancements in virology, an increasing understanding of cancer biology, and growing investments in research and development. Additionally, the success of current clinical trials and approvals of oncolytic virus therapies by regulatory authorities are fostering optimism among stakeholders. </p><p>Latest trends in the market include the emergence of combination therapies involving oncolytic viruses and checkpoint inhibitors, enhancing treatment efficacy. Furthermore, there is a growing focus on personalized medicine, with efforts to tailor viral therapies to individual patient profiles. Rising awareness of cancer therapies and supportive government initiatives also play crucial roles in propelling market growth.</p></p>
