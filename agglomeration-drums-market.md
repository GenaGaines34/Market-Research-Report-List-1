<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agglomeration Drums Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agglomeration drums are equipment used in the granulation process to create uniform pellets from fine powders. In the wet agglomeration market, moisture is added to facilitate particle adhesion, resulting in larger, cohesive granules ideal for specific applications. Conversely, the dry agglomeration market employs mechanical force to compact and shape powders without the addition of moisture, producing dense granules with minimal alteration in particle properties. Both methods cater to diverse industries, including pharmaceuticals and agriculture, targeting different material characteristics and processing needs.</p></p>
