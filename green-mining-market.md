<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Green Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface</li><li>Underground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Green mining refers to environmentally responsible practices in resource extraction, primarily divided into two market types: surface and underground mining. Surface mining involves removing overburden to access mineral deposits, resulting in larger land disturbances but potentially lower energy consumption. In contrast, underground mining minimizes surface disruption, as it involves excavating tunnels to extract minerals, often leading to higher energy usage and costs. Both methods aim to implement sustainable practices, reducing environmental impact and promoting resource conservation.</p></p>
